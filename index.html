        Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point.
         When you click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code for the video you want
        to add. You can also type a keyword to search online
        for the video that best fits your document. To make your document look
        professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page,
        and text box designs that complement each other. For example, you can
        add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then 
        choose the elements you want from the different galleries. Themes and 
        styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design
        and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change 
        to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings change to match 
        the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need 
        them. To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a butto
        n for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click
